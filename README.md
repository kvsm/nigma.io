## Who are we?
A developer community for students studying computing related courses, entry level developers wanting to broaden their horizons and senior developers that want to help others that were once in the position they were in. Nigma was created through the frustration of one Computer Science student that had always wanted to learn, but didn't know exactly what to learn. 

## What is our aim?
The main aim of Nigma is to try and bridge this gap between what software development students learn in education and what is being demanded in the workplace. With NI employers in high demand for top developers, we want to help empower students to help them reach their full potential through keeping them up to date on the latest technology stacks, tech meetups and career prospects. Our target audience is for senior students and graduates that are, either about to, or have just entered NI's software development industry.
